/**
 * Trade Tax Specialists lead-nurture composition: the contactability sequence
 * and detail-capture sequence for CIS subcontractor enquiries.
 *
 * SERVICE-ONLY (compliance): every message is a solicited, non-promotional
 * follow-up about the enquirer's OWN enquiry. No marketing content. This
 * keeps us inside the "rely on existing LIA, service-only" posture and
 * PECR's solicited-comms carve-out.
 *
 * Audience: CIS subcontractors, sole-trader and limited-company trades,
 * construction workers looking at CIS refunds, penalties, gross payment
 * status, VAT reverse charge, and take-home optimisation.
 *
 * Cadence: an instant email (step 0) fires synchronously at submit. Then
 * 7 escalating follow-ups over approximately 11 days.
 * Cumulative delay hours from step 0: 0, 0, 4, 24, 48, 96, 168, 264.
 *
 * House style: no em-dashes. British English. Faceless team voice (no named
 * individual). No credential claims. No cross-vertical bleed (no property,
 * medical, or dentists content here).
 *
 * // ponytail: phase-2, replies inert while dormant
