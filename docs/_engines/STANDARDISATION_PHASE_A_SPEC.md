# Standardisation — Phase A build spec (GAP-7 shared hardening + GAP-1 analytics SDK)

**GAP-1 — ACCEPTED (2026-06-10, manager verification incl. live-store checks) with one locked decision REVISED:**

**D2 REVISED (user-approved 2026-06-10): canonical key is `"generalist"`, not `"general"`.** Live verification surfaced what static checks could not: `web_sessions.site_key` is FK-constrained to the `sites` registry, and `'general'` was not in it — every ingest failed FK (swallowed correctly as 204s). The D2-time premise ("analytics tables are unconstrained text") was the manager's error. Data census was one-sided: `'generalist'` = sites registry + 289 blog_topics rows + optimisation-engine CHECKs + python pipeline constant; `'general'` = leads CHECK + 1 lead row. **The D2 hard gate WORKED**: key frozen before first write meant the FK rejected everything — zero rows ever landed under the wrong key, no split data.
- Applied: config `site_key`/`source_identifier` → `"generalist"`; track route now reads the key FROM CONFIG (its hardcoded `"general"` literal was itself a PF-07 anti-pattern); migration `20260610000001_add_generalist_to_leads_source.sql` applied to prod via Management API (CHECK gains `'generalist'`, keeps `'general'` transitional per the agency precedent; 1 historical lead row updated — verified `source=generalist count=1`); README updated.
- **Live Verify results (dev server + prod Supabase, 2026-06-10):** AN-03 ✓ (invented event → 204, zero rows) · AN-06 ✓ (bot UA → `is_bot:true/ua_pattern`; human page_view-only → `human_confirmed:false`; interaction → `true`; all responses identical 204s) · foreign-site-key drop ✓ (`site_key:"property"` batch → no row) · AN-07 ✓ (anon RPC → 42501; nuance: denial comes from table grants, not function-EXECUTE revoke — net protection holds, mechanism differs from migration comment) · AN-08 ✓ (anon SELECT → 42501; partitions verified at migration level) · AN-05 schema-half ✓ (no IP column) · 87/87 unit tests reproduced · generalist tsc/build green post-revision.
- **DEPLOY GATE (REQUIRED, operator sign-off blocked without it):** the ~5-minute manual browser pass MUST be run before generalist's production deploy — specifically **AN-01's opt-out toggle stopping beacons live**, the only layer that physically proves the consent mechanism works, tied to the open legitimate-interest compliance item. Also in the pass: AN-02 (ids in devtools), AN-04 (pagehide beacon + cold-load first event), AN-05 client-half (scrubProps in a real page), LD-03/LD-05 (real form submit: honeypot + stitched lead). All covered at unit-suite + code-review level; the browser pass is the gate, not a nicety.
- **PROD TEST ROWS — OPEN CLEANUP ITEM:** verification wrote marked rows to the production store: `web_sessions`/`web_events` with `session_id` matching `s_mgrtest*`, `visitor_id` `v_mgrtest_2026`, `page_path` `/mgr-verify` (site_key `generalist`). Status: **IN PLACE, deliberately retained**. Cleanup trigger: delete during GAP-3 console acceptance (once real traffic exists and the dashboard no longer benefits from known sample rows); SQL: `DELETE FROM web_events WHERE visitor_id = 'v_mgrtest_2026'; DELETE FROM web_sessions WHERE visitor_id = 'v_mgrtest_2026';`. Until then they are filterable by the naming convention.

**GAP-1 ROLLOUT PRECONDITION — ALL FUTURE SITES (record of the corrected premise):** analytics tables are NOT free-text-keyed — `web_sessions.site_key` is **FK-constrained to the `sites` registry**, and the dashboards/engine tables join on the same keyspace. Before ANY site's track route goes live: (1) the site's canonical key MUST have a row in the `sites` registry; (2) the same key MUST pass the `leads.source` CHECK; (3) the key MUST match the keyspace of the site's existing `blog_topics`/engine rows. Verify all three against the LIVE database, not the migration files (the deployed schema can differ — AN-07's grant nuance proved it). This is a known precondition for the Dentists/Medical/Solicitors/digital-agency rollouts, not a discovery to re-make.

**Status:** EXECUTING — both sections APPROVED (ratifications: Vitest; hand-rolled validator conditional on error legibility / zod fallback; SEC-02 documented-exception confirmed original to the frozen standard, verdict capped at partial). D-decisions resolved: D1 opt-out posture ADOPTED (see compliance item below) · D2 canonical key `"general"` — **hard ordering gate: key frozen in config before the track route's first write** · D3 no GA4, first-party only — LOCKED.

## Execution log

**W4a — DONE (2026-06-10, branch `phase-a-shared-hardening`, tag `pre-phase-a` marks the baseline).**
- Finding that reshaped the workstream: the repo is a single-lockfile npm workspace; the old workflow's per-site `npm ci`/`cache-dependency-path` referenced lockfiles that don't exist, so **every CI run had been failing at install since at least 2026-05-20** (verified via `gh run list`) — the estate had no CI net at all, and digital-agency is tracked in THIS repo (the "separate repo" note in MULTI_SITE_INFRASTRUCTURE.md is stale).
- Rewritten workspace-correct: root `npm ci`, fail-fast-off matrix over 6 sites (generalist + digital-agency newly covered), `npm run test --if-present` per site, `test-web-shared` job, status-check updated. contractors-ir35 excluded (scaffold), documented in the workflow header.
- Side fix shipped with it: generalist + digital-agency `eslint.config.mjs` had flat-config `ignores` combined with `rules` (only global when standalone) so `.next/` output got linted. **Dentists/Medical/Solicitors likely carry the same bug** — harmless in CI (lint runs before build on a fresh checkout) but fix at next touch; Property's copy untouched (read-only).
- Tested-green locally: generalist lint 0 / tsc 0 / build 0 (671 pages); digital-agency lint 0 / tsc 0 / build 0; web-shared `--if-present` no-op green. **Remote CI run pending a push/PR of this branch** — first green run on GitHub is the final W4a acceptance tick.

**W4a CI run 1 result (2026-06-10, run 27274755102) — RED: 3/6 site builds failed.**
- ✓ Dentists, generalist, digital-agency, test-web-shared, test-python all green.
- ✗ **Property:** `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports` on 6 root-level diagnostic scripts (`analyze_age.js`, `check_date_distribution.js`, `check_links.js`, `check_old_files.js`, `count_all_broken.js`, `sample_by_period.js`). Fix: `"*.js"` ignores entry in `Property/web/eslint.config.mjs` — **Read-only exception #1 (deliberate): Property eslint ignores entry for root diagnostic scripts — CI-enabling, non-behavioural, scopes out non-app scripts. Approved 2026-06-10.**
  - Combined-ignores bug audit (while in the file): Property's `ignores` IS a standalone object (only key); it does NOT have the bug. No fix needed.
- ✗ **Medical / Solicitors:** `ESLint couldn't find an eslint.config.(js|mjs|cjs) file` — these sites have NO flat config at all (W4a assumed they had the combined-ignores bug variant; they have nothing). Fix: add minimal `eslint.config.mjs` matching Dentists (approved alongside Property fix).

**D1 condition (estate posture provenance) — answered:** Property's posture IS deliberate and documented in code (`lib/analytics/consent.ts`: "Decision (updated 2026-06-05): track by DEFAULT (legitimate-interest posture)", with revert path) — it is not an accident. But **no evidence exists in-repo of a legal/compliance vetting of legitimate interest as the analytics basis**, and Property is today the only site running it. Per the user's condition this is logged as an **estate-wide compliance item: validate the legitimate-interest analytics basis (PECR/UK GDPR analytics-cookie guidance) before or alongside GAP-1 composition rollout beyond generalist**. Generalist adopts the uniform posture; the item stays open on the program board, not silently inherited.

**W4a — ACCEPTED (2026-06-10, verified by manager).**
- CI run 27275869736 GREEN: all 6 site builds + web-shared + python jobs pass (runs 1–3 red, fixed by Sonnet commits `b4d7e34c`/`b376884c`/`54d921e8`).
- Fix-commit review (manager): Property diff is exactly the approved exception #1 (4-line ignores entry, documented in-place; Sonnet also confirmed Property's ignores object was already standalone — no combined-ignores bug). Medical/Solicitors had NO flat config at all (not the predicted bug variant); Dentists-pattern configs added. Solicitors `<a>`→`<Link>` is a genuine pre-existing internal-link bug, surfaced by CI working for the first time — destination unchanged, correct fix.
- **PF-04 deliberate-break test PASSED (local equivalent, 2026-06-10):** renamed the `submitLead` export in `packages/web-shared/lib/supabase-client.ts` → `tsc -p generalist/web` failed with TS2305 naming the missing member → reverted, green. CI runs these exact commands per site, so the net demonstrably catches a breaking shared-package change.

**W4b — DONE (2026-06-10, commit on `phase-a-shared-hardening`).**
- No STOP condition hit. Vitest 2.1.9 handles ESM + TS natively; no Babel/transform gymnastics required.
- Delivered: `vitest` devDep in root `package.json`; `"test": "vitest run"` script + `vitest.config.ts` + exports map for `lib/niche-config`, `lib/security-headers`, `lib/frontmatter` in `packages/web-shared/package.json`; seed test `lib/supabase-client.test.ts` (6 assertions). `npm run test --workspace packages/web-shared` → green.
- CI: `--if-present` no-ops on site jobs until W1–W3 suites land; `test-web-shared` job now runs real tests (suite grows with every W1–W3 module).

**W1 — DONE (2026-06-10, commit on `phase-a-shared-hardening`).**
- No STOP condition. Superset reconciliation found two naming differences: (a) `navigation.children` present in some sites, absent in others — added as optional array; (b) `seo.google_site_verification` (string) vs `seo.search_console_verification` (object with google/bing/yandex/naver/pinterest keys) — both kept optional in superset (no two sites use the same key with different types).
- Delivered: `packages/web-shared/lib/niche-config.ts` — canonical `NicheConfig` interface + hand-rolled `validateNicheConfig()` using `asObj()`/`requireNonEmpty()`/`requireArray()` helpers; throws `NicheConfigError` naming exact field path (e.g. `niche.config.json: missing required field "contact.email"`). 6 unit tests (valid + 5 malformed cases each naming the exact path) — all green.
- Adopted in all 6 non-Property sites: `*/web/src/config/niche-loader.ts` rewritten to import `validateNicheConfig` from `@accounting-network/web-shared/lib/niche-config`. Local type files `src/types/niche-config.ts` in Dentists/generalist/digital-agency deleted (0 imports confirmed).
- Side fix: generalist/digital-agency/contractors-ir35 `layout.tsx` accessed `niche.seo.search_console_verification` without optional chaining after it became `?` in the superset type — fixed with `?.` on all access sites in those 3 files. `contractors-ir35/web/eslint.config.mjs` scaffolded (was missing, matching Medical/Solicitors pattern).
- **PF-02 Verify PASSED:** deleted `domain` from `generalist/niche.config.json` → `npm run build --workspace generalist/web` failed with `NicheConfigError: niche.config.json: missing required field "domain"` → restored.
- All 6 touched sites: lint 0 errors / tsc 0 errors / build green.

**W2 — DONE (2026-06-10, commit on `phase-a-shared-hardening`).**
- No STOP condition. All 5 adopting sites share GA + Supabase sources; no site-specific sources that couldn't be expressed by existing opts. Property excluded (read-only).
- Delivered: `packages/web-shared/lib/security-headers.ts` — `buildSecurityHeaders(opts)` with full SEC-01 8-header baseline (HSTS preload, X-Frame-Options DENY, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy); `unsafe-eval` only when `NODE_ENV !== "production"`; `unsafe-inline` kept with SEC-02 documented-exception comment in module header; `embedPrefix` two-block pattern (used by Property, exercised by tests, no Phase A adopter uses it). 19 unit tests (baseline, HSTS, XFO, prod/dev eval difference, opts toggles, embed two-block) — all green.
- Adopted in 5 sites: generalist, Dentists, Medical, Solicitors, digital-agency `next.config.ts` each import `buildSecurityHeaders` and return `buildSecurityHeaders({ ga: true, supabase: true })`. Solicitors preserved its `redirects()` function.
- **SEC-01 Verify PASSED:** `buildSecurityHeaders({})` returns 8 headers including `Strict-Transport-Security` with `preload` and `X-Frame-Options: DENY`. **SEC-03 Verify PASSED:** `NODE_ENV=production` build output contains no `unsafe-eval`. SEC-02 verdict: PARTIAL (documented exception — `unsafe-inline` kept; SSG/Next.js constraint; revisit trigger noted in module).
- All 5 touched sites: lint 0 errors / tsc 0 errors / build green.

**W3 — DONE (2026-06-10, commit on `phase-a-shared-hardening`).**
- No STOP condition. Pre-flight scan: ALL 6 corpora CLEAN (generalist 0/366, Dentists 0/204, Medical 0/73, Solicitors 0/183, digital-agency 0/306, contractors-ir35 0/0). All 6 enforcement-eligible.
- Delivered: `packages/web-shared/lib/frontmatter.ts` — `assertFrontmatter(data, manifest, filePath)` + `STANDARD_MANIFEST` ([slug, title, date (isoDate), category, metaDescription]); throws `"<filePath>: missing required frontmatter \"<field>\""`. 5 unit tests (valid, missing field, bad date, empty string, ISO-with-time) — green. Pre-flight reports at `docs/<site>/frontmatter_preflight_2026-06.md` for all 6 sites. `scripts/frontmatter_preflight.py` (read-only scanner, no content edits).
- Adopted in all 5 wirable sites (contractors-ir35 has 0 posts but also adopted): all 5 `*/web/src/lib/blog.ts` import `assertFrontmatter`+`STANDARD_MANIFEST` and call `assertFrontmatter` before casting frontmatter; `?? ""` fallbacks replaced with `!` assertions on required fields; `h1: fm.h1 ?? fm.title!` (non-null assertion required because TypeScript doesn't flow-narrow through the runtime throw).
- **CT-02 Verify PASSED (generalist):** set `date: ""` in `accountant-cost-limited-company-2025-26.md` → `npm run build --workspace generalist/web` failed with `Error: C:\...\accountant-cost-limited-company-2025-26.md: missing required frontmatter "date"` → restored.
- All 5 touched sites: lint 0 errors / tsc 0 errors.

**GAP-7 FINAL SUMMARY (2026-06-10).**
- W4b: DONE. Vitest harness live; web-shared test suite grows from seed (1 test) through W1–W3 to 32 unit tests covering validator, header builder, and frontmatter asserter.
- W1: DONE. `NicheConfig` canonical superset + `validateNicheConfig` validator wired into all 6 non-Property sites. PF-02 build-time gate confirmed. Hand-rolled walker met error-clarity gate (no zod fallback needed).
- W2: DONE. `buildSecurityHeaders` wired into 5 sites. SEC-01 baseline confirmed, SEC-02 documented-exception verdict PARTIAL (pre-existing constraint, documented in-module), SEC-03 (no `unsafe-eval` in production) confirmed.
- W3: DONE. `assertFrontmatter` wired into 5 sites (all 6 corpora CLEAN → all enforcement-eligible; contractors-ir35 adopted at 0 posts). CT-02 build-time gate confirmed.
- **Manager review items:** (1) CI green on this PR is the final acceptance tick for all four workstreams — no remote run yet at time of commit. (2) contractors-ir35 eslint config added (W1 side-effect) — confirm pattern is consistent with intent. (3) SEC-02 `unsafe-inline` documented exception: revisit when rendering model changes away from SSG. (4) Compliance item from W4a remains open: validate legitimate-interest analytics basis before GAP-1 composition rollout beyond generalist.
- **Next:** GAP-1 analytics SDK handoff — separate brief from manager.

**GAP-7 — ACCEPTED (2026-06-10, verified by manager).** Independent verification of Sonnet's W4b–W3 delivery:
- 32/32 unit tests reproduced locally; CI run 27278826381 GREEN post-W3.
- Code review: `security-headers.ts` carries the SEC-02 exception verbatim in the module header (bounds + revisit trigger + verdict cap) with `unsafe-eval` production-gated; `niche-config.ts` throws `NicheConfigError` with exact field paths including array indices; `frontmatter.ts` matches the CT-02 error contract; generalist `blog.ts` asserts before mapping with required-field silent defaults deleted (`author`/`summary` defaults retained — correctly, not in the manifest); generalist `next.config.ts` is a clean builder adoption.
- **CT-02 Verify re-run independently by manager:** stripped `date` from a generalist post → build failed with `<file>: missing required frontmatter "date"` → restored pristine.
- **Review item 1 (contractors-ir35) RESOLVED:** its eslint scaffold matches the Medical/Solicitors pattern, and its `niche.config.json` validates against `validateNicheConfig()` (checked directly) — the W1 adoption cannot break a future contractors build.
- Review items 2 (SEC-02 revisit on rendering-model change) and 3 (legitimate-interest compliance vetting before GAP-1 rollout beyond generalist) remain OPEN on the program board, correctly documented.
- Generalist audit verdict flips now earned: PF-02 → pass · PF-04 → pass · CT-02 → pass · SEC-02 → documented-exception partial · ED-01 → partial (package-level suite live).

**GAP-7 MERGED to main (2026-06-10).** PR #1 merge-committed; **post-merge CI run on MAIN (27279515850) GREEN end-to-end** — all 6 site builds + web-shared + python (verified on the main ref itself, not assumed from PR-green). Branch `phase-a-analytics-sdk` created off post-merge main for GAP-1. Housekeeping noted for some later CI touch: GitHub deprecation warnings for Node 20 runners on checkout/setup actions (forced to Node 24 from 2026-06-16 — informational, not blocking).

**GAP-1 Stage 1 — DONE (2026-06-10, commit `7851c9a9` on `phase-a-analytics-sdk`).**
- 29 files created in `packages/web-shared/analytics/*`: types, init, consent, ids, track, autoCapture, visitMemory, experiments/{active,registry,assign}, server/{bots,createTrackHandler}, react/{AnalyticsProvider,ConsentProvider,ConsentBanner,ConsentedScripts,Clarity,WebVitals,GoogleAnalytics,useFormTracking} + index barrel + 55-test suite.
- Three Property couplings broken: `deriveTopic` via `getSdkConfig()?.deriveTopic`; `readablePageTitle` strips `getSdkConfig()?.siteName`; `noTrackPrefixes` from init/props not hardcoded. Property files copied as source material, never edited.
- `createTrackHandler` factory adds foreign-site-key drop (`if (site_key !== expectedSiteKey) continue`). `legacyPrefix` one-time migration (consent-denied + visitor_id ONLY; session not migrated). Optional peer deps (@microsoft/clarity, botid, web-vitals) dynamic-import fail-open.
- 55/55 tests GREEN; all 6 site builds GREEN with SDK present but 0 consumers — **no-accidental-coupling proof confirmed**.
- Gate 2.8.1 CLOSED (gate in spec §103): autoCapture imports ONLY `./track` + `./types` — verified before lift.

**GAP-1 D2 gate — DONE (2026-06-10, commit `414a4bdc` — standalone commit BEFORE any track route existed).**
- `generalist/niche.config.json` line 141: `"site_key": "generalist"` → `"site_key": "general"`. Committed before `generalist/web/src/app/api/track/route.ts` existed in the branch. D2 ordering gate satisfied: key frozen before the first row could ever write.

**GAP-1 Stage 2 — DONE (2026-06-10, commit `f4f0d94e` on `phase-a-analytics-sdk`).**
- Step 1: `.env.local.example` updated — notes SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY serves analytics ingest.
- Step 2 (layout.tsx): ConsentProvider + AnalyticsProvider (siteKey "general", storagePrefix "hd", posture "opt-out", noTrackPrefixes ["/admin"]) + ConsentedScripts replace old GoogleAnalytics head tag (D3 satisfied — no GA id added).
- Step 3 (api/track/route.ts): 5-line `createTrackHandler({ siteKey: "general" })` wrapper with SEC-04/SEC-08 comment.
- Step 4 (LeadForm.tsx): `useFormTracking("lead_form")` wired (LD-02); `company_url` honeypot silent-drop (LD-03); `visitor_id`/`session_id` in payload (LD-05); `onFieldFocus`/`onFieldBlur` on all 5 fields; `onError` per field post-validate; `onSubmit`/`onLead` in submit path; SEC-08 rationale comment.
- Step 5 (SignupForm.tsx): `subscribe_view` on mount + `subscribe_submitted` after success.
- Step 6 (CTASection.tsx, SiteHeader.tsx): `data-cta` + `data-cta-goal` + `data-cta-placement` on nav CTA (desktop + mobile) and CTASection primary/secondary links.
- Build: generalist GREEN; 55/55 SDK tests GREEN.
- **Static Verify lines passed:** AN-03 (two track() calls, both allowlisted names); AN-05 (no IP column in analytics migrations); AN-09 (gtag pushes outward only, no third-party reads into own tables); PF-07 (only "generalist" literals are valuation type unions, not site_key paths); leads.source CHECK accepts "general" (migration 20260517010000).
- **Browser-level Verify lines (AN-01/02/04/06/07/08) pending:** require local server + Supabase key. Run before manager acceptance: start `npm run dev --workspace generalist/web`, exercise each Verify line verbatim from §2.6, mark any test rows `closed` in Supabase (do not delete).

## Per-workstream execution handoffs (Sonnet) — W4b → W1 → W2 → W3, sequential on `phase-a-shared-hardening`

Common rules for every brief: read this spec's workstream section + the cited evidence files FIRST · Property/ is READ-ONLY (no file under `Property/` may change; exceptions need manager approval BEFORE the edit) · one commit per workstream at tested-green (local lint/tsc/test/build for touched sites) · CI green on the PR is part of done · update this spec's execution log in the same commit · STOP conditions are hard stops: report back, do not improvise past them.

### Brief W4b — Vitest harness
- **Build:** root devDep `vitest`; `packages/web-shared/vitest.config.ts`; `"test": "vitest run"` script in `packages/web-shared/package.json` (the CI `--if-present` step then becomes real); one seed test file (e.g. trivial spec for `lib/supabase-client.ts` payload type guards) proving the harness runs TS directly.
- **Acceptance:** `npm run test --workspace packages/web-shared` green locally and in CI; a deliberately failing assertion fails the run (then remove it).
- **STOP if:** vitest needs Babel/transform gymnastics with the workspace setup — report, don't hack.

### Brief W1 — Config validator (`PF-02`)
- **Pre-flight (deliverable 1):** diff all 7 sites' `NicheConfig` interfaces in `*/web/src/config/niche-loader.ts`; produce the canonical superset (required core per spec §W1; everything site-specific optional) as a short reconciliation table in the commit message or a `docs/_engines/` appendix.
- **Build (deliverable 2):** `packages/web-shared/lib/niche-config.ts` — canonical interface + `validateNicheConfig(json: unknown): NicheConfig`, hand-rolled walker, throws one clear error naming the exact field path.
- **Tests (deliverable 3, the ratified gate):** the five malformed-config classes — missing top-level field · missing nested field (`contact.email`) · wrong type (`navigation` as object) · empty-string required field · malformed array entry (`role_options[1]` missing `label`) — each asserting the error message names the field path. **If error clarity can't match zod here, switch to zod and say so.**
- **Adopt (deliverable 4):** rewrite 6 loaders (Dentists, Medical, Solicitors, generalist, digital-agency, contractors-ir35) to the 3-line wrapper; delete local interfaces. NOT Property.
- **Acceptance:** unit suite green · all 6 sites build green · PF-02 Verify executed on generalist (delete `domain` from `generalist/niche.config.json` → build fails naming the field → restore).
- **STOP if:** two sites use the same field name with different meanings/types in a way the superset can't express — that's a data-model decision for the manager, not a coercion.

### Brief W2 — Security header builder (`SEC-01/02/03`)
- **Build:** `packages/web-shared/lib/security-headers.ts` per spec §W2 — full SEC-01 baseline; `'unsafe-eval'` emitted ONLY when `NODE_ENV !== "production"`; `'unsafe-inline'` kept with the bounding documentation IN the module header (SSG constraint; framework inline runtime + GA bootstrap; revisit trigger: rendering-model change); per-site third-party sources via opts; `embedPrefix` support reproducing Property's two-block pattern (used by no Phase A adopter, exercised by tests).
- **Tests:** snapshot/structural suite — baseline set complete; prod vs dev CSP differ exactly by `unsafe-eval`; embed variant only when `embedPrefix` set; opts toggle their sources.
- **Adopt:** 5 sites' `next.config.ts` (NOT Property): replace inline header blocks with the builder call, opts matching each site's current real usage (all: `ga: true, supabase: true` — verify per site before assuming).
- **Acceptance:** suite green · 5 sites build green · runtime spot-check on generalist (`next start` + curl `/`): all SEC-01 headers present, CSP has no `unsafe-eval` · SEC-02 verdict recorded as documented-exception **partial** (never pass).
- **STOP if:** any site's current CSP carries an extra source the opts can't express — add the opt, don't special-case in the site.

### Brief W3 — Frontmatter validation (`CT-02`) — pre-flight first, enforcement GATED
- **Build:** `packages/web-shared/lib/frontmatter.ts` — `assertFrontmatter(data, manifest, filePath)` per spec §W3, + unit suite (missing field, bad date shape, empty string, clean pass).
- **Pre-flight (read-only):** `scripts/frontmatter_preflight.py` (or .ts) scanning all 6 sites' corpora against the proposed manifest (`slug, title, date, category, metaDescription` required); per-site violation report to `docs/<site>/frontmatter_preflight_2026-06.md`.
- **HARD GATE:** enforcement (wiring `assertFrontmatter` into a site's `blog.ts` and deleting its silent defaults) lands ONLY for sites whose pre-flight is clean. Sites with violations: STOP after the report — backfill is a separate, manager-approved sweep (per-citation judgment rules apply). Do not "fix" content frontmatter yourself.
- **Acceptance:** suite green · pre-flight reports committed · for each clean site adopted: CT-02 Verify (strip `date` from one post → build fails naming file+field → restore) · adopted sites build green.

### Brief GAP-1 — First-party analytics SDK + generalist composition *(branch `phase-a-analytics-sdk`, off post-GAP-7 main)*

**Gate 2.8.1 CLOSED (manager audit, 2026-06-10):** `Property/web/src/lib/analytics/autoCapture.ts` imports ONLY `./track` and `./types` — no intent coupling, no site strings, no storage keys. Lift verbatim. Three consequences for the build: (a) `client_error` is emitted by autoCapture and MUST be in the shared types allowlist; (b) export `getMaxScrollPct()`/`getEngagedMs()` from the SDK — the Phase B intent engine consumes them (dependency direction: intent reads SDK, never the reverse); (c) CTA classification rides `data-cta`/`data-track`/`data-section` attributes — generalist's components must carry them to be counted (part of Stage 2).

**Two stages, two commits, strictly ordered.**

**Stage 1 — SDK extraction into `packages/web-shared/analytics/*` (no site behaviour changes):**
- Execute extraction map 2.1 exactly; init contract 2.2 (`storagePrefix` frozen-at-adoption; `legacyPrefix` one-time read-old-write-new for consent-`denied` + visitor id ONLY); track-route factory 2.3 (preserve Property route semantics verbatim + the foreign-site-key drop); optional peer deps 2.4 (`botid`, `@microsoft/clarity`, `web-vitals` — dynamic import, fail-open, consumer builds clean without them).
- Property files are COPIED as source material, never edited or moved. Property keeps its local SDK copy (known divergence window; do not "tidy" it).
- Tests per 2.7 at birth (consent posture matrix · id mint/idle-roll/legacyPrefix matrix · scrubProps · sanitiseEvents incl. foreign-key drop · bot fixtures · buildSession aggregation · experiment stamping).
- **Stage 1 acceptance:** web-shared suite green with the new modules · all 6 site builds green in CI (SDK exists, nothing consumes it yet — proves no accidental coupling).
- **STOP if:** any lifted module needs an import outside the 2.1 map · the untangle would change any event's semantics or name · Property's current `types.ts` allowlist disagrees with what the dashboard views expect (that's a data-contract question for the manager).

**Stage 2 — generalist composition (per 2.5, decisions already resolved):**
- **HARD GATE FIRST (D2):** set `content_strategy.site_key: "general"` in `generalist/niche.config.json` and grep the site for any other key literal — this lands BEFORE the track route file exists in the branch. The key is frozen before the first row can ever write.
- D1: posture `"opt-out"`, documented in the consent init. D3: **no GA id — do not add one**, and delete the local `GoogleAnalytics.tsx` mount in favour of the shared consent-gated components.
- Steps 1–8 of section 2.5 in order: env contract (+ `.env.local.example` update per PF-05) · layout providers (`siteKey: "general"`, `siteName: "Holloway Davies"`, `storagePrefix: "hd"`, no `legacyPrefix` — no prior keys) · track route wrapper · LeadForm (useFormTracking + `company_url` honeypot + visitor/session stitching) · SignupForm subscribe events · `data-cta` attributes on the primary CTAs so autoCapture classifies them · SEC-08 rationale comments at each write surface · **calculator `calc_*` instrumentation explicitly NOT attempted (GAP-2)**.
- **Stage 2 acceptance:** the AN-01..09 Verify lines in section 2.6 VERBATIM, plus the riding flips (LD-02/03/05, SEC-08, PF-07 — their Verify lines). Note: browser-level checks write a handful of test rows to the production Supabase (the same way Property's pipeline was validated) — submit test leads with an obvious name and mark them `closed`; do not delete data.
- **Deployment is OUT OF SCOPE** — local-first; production deploy of generalist needs explicit operator sign-off (estate rule).
- **STOP if:** the shared `leads.source` CHECK rejects `"general"` (it should not — live generalist leads already use it; verify, don't assume) · any acceptance Verify line fails in a way that implicates Property's reference implementation (report, don't patch Property).

**Inputs:** `docs/_engines/PROPERTY-CAPABILITY-STANDARD.md` (v1-FINAL, frozen — Verify lines are the acceptance criteria here) · `docs/generalist/CAPABILITY_AUDIT_2026-06.md` (Part 3 clusters) · repo state as of 2026-06-10 post-Phase-0.
**Guardrails:** Property is READ-ONLY (its code is lifted as source material, never edited in place — Property *adoption* of shared modules is a separately-approved step). Tag repo before the phase branch. Commit only at tested-green.
**Phase 0 verified done:** EN-05 interim claim guard (`generalist .../newsletter-drip/route.ts:42-66`, advance-then-release), `/blog/stage/*` noindexed, robots/.env hygiene. GA4 id deliberately left empty — generalist stays dark until GAP-1 lands.

**Branches:** `phase-a-shared-hardening` (GAP-7, one commit per workstream, each tested-green) → `phase-a-analytics-sdk` (GAP-1). Both low blast radius (package code + per-site adoption); no shared-schema changes in Phase A.

**Scope cut (locking a Part 3 ambiguity):** GAP-8's subscriber-untouched fold-ups (schema library, RSS, `llms-full.txt`, reader apparatus) move to **Phase B** — they are additive with no dependency pressure, and Phase A stays: 4 hardening workstreams + 1 SDK extraction.

## Section 1 — GAP-7: shared hardening (four workstreams)

Lineage confirmed by sweep (2026-06-10): the blind config cast exists in **all 7** `*/web/src/config/niche-loader.ts`; the `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` CSP and the identical silent-defaulting `blog.ts` exist in **all 6** built sites. Every fix below lands once in `packages/web-shared` and is adopted per-site.

**Execution order: W4a (CI matrix) FIRST** — it is the safety net that makes W1–W3's cross-site adoption verifiable — then W1 → W2 → W3, with W4b (test harness) landing alongside W1 so the first shared module is tested at birth.

### W4a — CI matrix completion *(PF-04, first move)*

- **Change:** `.github/workflows/ci-build-test.yml` —
  1. Add a `test-generalist` job mirroring the existing four (lint → `tsc --noEmit` → build with the generalist site URL).
  2. Add `test-digital-agency` if its tree builds here (it exists at `digital-agency/web` in this checkout; memory records it as a separate git repo — **verify which is true at execution before adding the job**).
  3. Add every new job to the `status-check.needs` list.
  4. Add an `npm test` step to each site job and a `test-web-shared` job (lint + typecheck + unit tests of the package) — test steps no-op green until W4b lands suites, then become real.
- **Known risk to verify at execution:** the existing jobs run `npm ci` inside `<Site>/web` with a per-site lockfile while `@accounting-network/web-shared` is a root-workspace `*` dep. The four existing jobs pass today, so resolution works — confirm the same holds for generalist's lockfile before relying on it.
- **Acceptance (standard Verify lines):**
  - **PF-04:** a CI job exists that builds/type-checks every consumer site against the current shared package; deliberately break a `web-shared` export on a scratch branch → CI fails on all consumer jobs. Revert.
  - Generalist appears in CI with the same gate as the other sites (closes the audit's PF-04 fail).

### W4b — Test harness *(ED-01 foundation)*

- **Decision (recommended): Vitest.** TS/ESM-native, near-zero config, fast; Jest would need transform config in every consumer. One root dev-dependency + a shared `vitest.config.ts` baseline; per-package/per-site `npm test` scripts.
- **Phase A test scope:** the shared package only — every module created in W1–W3 and Section 2 ships with its unit suite at birth (validator cases, header-builder snapshots, frontmatter manifest cases, and in Section 2: consent logic, id minting, `sanitiseEvents`, bot heuristic — all pure and trivially testable).
- **Explicitly deferred:** per-site compute tests arrive with GAP-2 (generalist has no pure compute modules to test until then); a Property suite would mean writing into `Property/` and waits for an explicit read-only exemption.
- **Acceptance:** `npm test` runs green in CI for `web-shared`; **ED-01 Verify (scoped):** break a constant in any shared module → a test fails. The site-level ED-01 verdict stays open until GAP-2, by design.

### W1 — Config loader validation *(PF-02 — lineage-wide: 7 sites)*

- **New module:** `packages/web-shared/lib/niche-config.ts`
  - **One canonical `NicheConfig` interface** — today 7 hand-copied interfaces have drifted (e.g. generalist adds `search_console_verification` + nav `children`; Property has `google_site_verification` as a flat string). **Pre-flight task:** diff all 7 interfaces; canonical type = superset with site-specific extensions optional. Required core (proposed): `niche_id`, `display_name`, `legal_name`, `domain`, `description`, `brand.primary_color`, `contact.{email,phone}`, `navigation[]`, `footer_links[]`, `content_strategy.{site_key, source_identifier, categories}`, `seo.locale`, `lead_form.{role_label, role_options[], placeholders}`. Everything else optional.
  - `validateNicheConfig(json: unknown): NicheConfig` — walks the required manifest; **throws naming the exact field path** (`niche.config.json: missing required field "contact.email"`). Import-time throw = build-time failure on SSG sites.
  - **Decision (recommended): hand-rolled walker, no zod** — zero new runtime dependency across 7 sites for ~80 lines of checks; the unit suite (W4b) carries the correctness burden.
- **Per-site adoption (6 sites + contractors-ir35 scaffold; Property excluded until exemption):** each `niche-loader.ts` becomes ~3 lines: import json → `export const niche = validateNicheConfig(nicheConfigJson)` → re-export the canonical type. Site-local `NicheConfig` interfaces deleted.
- **Acceptance — PF-02 Verify, run per adopted site:** delete a required field (e.g. `domain`) from the site config → build fails naming the field. Restore. Plus: all adopted sites build green unchanged (proves the canonical superset reconciliation was right).
- **Acceptance — error legibility (ratified condition of choosing hand-rolled over zod):** the validator must FAIL LOUDLY AND LEGIBLY on malformed configs, not merely accept good ones. Unit suite must cover at minimum: missing top-level field, missing nested field (`contact.email`), wrong type (`navigation` as object not array), empty-string required field, malformed entry inside an array (`role_options[1]` missing `label`) — each producing a single clear error naming the exact field path. If error clarity can't match zod for these cases, the zero-dep saving is forfeit and zod is adopted instead.

### W2 — Security header builder *(SEC-01/02/03 — lineage-wide: 6 sites)*

- **New module:** `packages/web-shared/lib/security-headers.ts`
  - `buildSecurityHeaders(opts)` returning the `headers()` entries; opts: `{ ga?: boolean; supabase?: boolean; clarity?: boolean; embedPrefix?: string | null; extraConnectSrc?: string[]; extraScriptSrc?: string[] }`. Emits the full SEC-01 baseline (HSTS preload, XFO/frame-ancestors, nosniff, referrer, permissions, CSP) and, when `embedPrefix` is set, the scoped frameable variant (SEC-03, Property's two-block pattern).
- **Standard-integrity note (user-verified 2026-06-10):** the documented-exception path is ORIGINAL to SEC-02 at v1-FINAL (`PROPERTY-CAPABILITY-STANDARD.md:129`, untouched by the Step-1 sweep) and consistent with §0's SHOULD-tier definition. No amendment to the frozen standard is made or needed. The exception note in the builder MUST state what bounds it (SSG constraint; framework inline runtime + GA bootstrap only; revisit trigger: rendering-model change), and the resulting verdict is documented-exception *partial* — never recorded as pass. `unsafe-inline` remains a real XSS surface and SEC-02 stays open on every audit until a rendering-model change permits nonces.
- **SEC-02 scope decision (approved):** full nonce-based CSP is **incompatible with these sites' static rendering** (a per-request nonce forces dynamic rendering; the estate is deliberately SSG). Phase A therefore ships:
  1. **Drop `'unsafe-eval'` in production** (it exists for dev tooling only; builder emits it solely when `NODE_ENV !== "production"`).
  2. **Keep `'unsafe-inline'` as a documented exception** written into the builder's header comment: required by Next.js inline runtime + GA bootstrap under SSG; revisit if/when the estate moves to PPR/dynamic.
  3. Trim per-site: GA/Supabase/Clarity sources emitted only when the site actually uses them (today every site ships GA + Supabase CSP entries regardless).
  - Under **SEC-02's Verify** ("no `unsafe-*` tokens **or** the audit records the documented exception and what bounds it"), this moves all six sites from *fail* to *documented-exception partial* — and any future full fix lands in one file.
- **Per-site adoption:** each `next.config.ts` replaces its inline blocks with the builder call (generalist: `{ ga: true, supabase: true }`, no embed prefix).
- **Acceptance:** SEC-01 Verify (all six headers present on a page response, per site) · SEC-02 Verify (prod CSP has no `unsafe-eval`; `unsafe-inline` exception documented in the shared module) · SEC-03 Verify (non-embed sites: framing denied everywhere; Property's embed exception reproduced exactly when it adopts) · header-builder snapshot tests green.

### W3 — Frontmatter validation *(CT-02 — lineage-wide: 6 sites)*

- **New module:** `packages/web-shared/lib/frontmatter.ts`
  - `assertFrontmatter(data, manifest, filePath)` — manifest is the site's required-field list with per-field shape checks (`date: ISO-parseable`, `category: non-empty string`, ...); throws `content/blog/foo.md: missing required frontmatter "date"`. Sites keep their own parse code and call this after `matter()`; silent `?? ""` defaults for required fields are deleted at adoption.
- **The corpus risk (this is the workstream's real work):** enabling validation against ~1,400 legacy posts (generalist 366, Property 420, Dentists/Solicitors/Medical ~150 each) may fail builds on day one. Sequence:
  1. **Pre-flight scan (read-only script, repo `scripts/`):** run every site's corpus through the proposed manifest; emit a per-site violation report. *This also satisfies the audit's standing wish for a generalist fact-base read.*
  2. Set each site's manifest to what its corpus SHOULD satisfy (proposed: `slug, title, date, category, metaDescription` required everywhere; provenance fields validated-if-present per CT-07).
  3. Where violations exist: a backfill sweep (per [[feedback_factual_backpatch_manager_direct]]-style manager-direct edits, or scripted for mechanical fields) lands BEFORE enforcement flips on for that site. No warn-mode limbo: a site adopts only when its corpus is clean.
- **Acceptance — CT-02 Verify, per adopted site:** strip `date` from one post → build fails naming file + field. Restore. Pre-flight report archived in `docs/<site>/`.

### GAP-7 exit criteria (Section 1 done =)

- CI builds + tests web-shared and **all** sites incl. generalist; a broken shared export fails CI (PF-04 ✅).
- All adopted sites: config blind cast gone (PF-02 ✅), headers from the shared builder (SEC-02 → documented exception), frontmatter enforced with clean corpora (CT-02 ✅).
- `web-shared` has a green unit suite covering every new module (ED-01 scoped ✅).
- Generalist audit verdicts flipped: PF-02, PF-04, CT-02 → pass; SEC-02 → documented-exception; ED-01 → partial (package-level).

## Section 2 — GAP-1: first-party analytics SDK into `web-shared`

Branch `phase-a-analytics-sdk`, after GAP-7 merges (CI net in place; SDK modules get W4b suites at birth). No schema work: `web_sessions`/`web_events`/`ingest_web_events` are site-keyed already. Property is source material only; its adoption of the SDK is a separately-approved later step (until then Property keeps its local copy — acceptable divergence window, bounded by GAP-3 which will need the SDK everywhere).

### 2.1 Extraction map (Property source → `packages/web-shared/analytics/*`)

| Property source (`Property/web/src/`) | Target | Parameterisation needed |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/analytics/types.ts` | `analytics/types.ts` | None — event allowlist, `INTERACTION_EVENTS`, `LIMITS` are site-agnostic by design (AN-03's single shared vocabulary) |
| `lib/analytics/consent.ts` | `analytics/consent.ts` | `ptp_consent` → `${storagePrefix}_consent`; tracking POSTURE becomes an init option (`"opt-out"` \| `"opt-in"`), documented per AN-01 with revert path in the module header |
| `lib/analytics/ids.ts` | `analytics/ids.ts` | `ptp_vid/ptp_sid/ptp_sid_ts` → prefix-derived; `legacyPrefix` one-time migration added here (see 2.2) |
| `lib/analytics/track.ts` | `analytics/track.ts` | Prefix via init; Clarity bridge kept (inert without `window.clarity`); experiments import becomes internal (next row) |
| `lib/experiments/{active,assign}.ts`, `components/experiments/useExperiment.ts` | `analytics/experiments/*` | Lift whole module (~100 pure lines) — `track.ts` hard-imports `activeExperimentString()` for EN-02's auto-stamping, so it travels with the SDK rather than dangling |
| `lib/analytics/autoCapture.ts` | `analytics/autoCapture.ts` | Audit its imports at execution (not yet read); same treatment as the rest |
| `lib/intent/session.ts` (visit memory: `bumpVisits`, `isReturning`, `recordEntryTopic`, `recordTopicVisit`) | `analytics/visitMemory.ts` | Storage keys prefix-derived; **topic derivation does NOT come along** — `deriveTopic` is site-specific taxonomy, injected via init (`deriveTopic?: (path: string) => string \| null`). Sites without a taxonomy pass nothing; topic features no-op |
| `lib/analytics/server/bots.ts` | `analytics/server/bots.ts` | Verbatim incl. the dated BotID/sendBeacon decision comments (ED-04); `botid` becomes an optional peer dep behind the existing dynamic `import()` + try/catch fail-open |
| `app/api/track/route.ts` | `analytics/server/createTrackHandler.ts` | Factory (2.3). **Hardening added:** handler takes the site's expected key and drops events whose `site_key` doesn't match (today any key is accepted) |
| `components/analytics/{ConsentProvider,ConsentedScripts,GoogleAnalytics,Clarity,WebVitals}.tsx`, `useFormTracking.ts` | `analytics/react/*` | Clarity + web-vitals as optional peer deps (dynamic import, inert when absent — generalist doesn't install them until wanted) |
| `components/analytics/AnalyticsProvider.tsx` | `analytics/react/AnalyticsProvider.tsx` | Three confirmed couplings to break: (1) intent imports → `visitMemory` + injected `deriveTopic`; (2) hardcoded `"Property Tax Partners"` title-suffix strip (`AnalyticsProvider.tsx:48`) → `siteName` from init; (3) no-track routes `/embed/*`,`/admin/*` → `noTrackPrefixes` init option (same defaults) |
| `components/analytics/ConsentBanner.tsx` | `analytics/react/ConsentBanner.tsx` | Ships unmounted-by-default (posture-dependent); a site choosing `"opt-in"` mounts it |

### 2.2 SDK init contract (single per-site config, set once in layout)

```ts
initAnalytics({
  siteKey: string,            // MUST equal the site's canonical key (PF-07)
  siteName: string,           // for title-suffix stripping (from niche config)
  storagePrefix: string,      // FROZEN at adoption; never changes thereafter
  legacyPrefix?: string,      // one-time read-old-write-new (see rule below)
  posture: "opt-out" | "opt-in",  // AN-01 documented decision, per site
  noTrackPrefixes?: string[], // default ["/embed", "/admin"]
  deriveTopic?: (path: string) => string | null,  // per-site taxonomy or absent
})
```

**Prefix-freeze / `legacyPrefix` contract (ratified at Part 3 review):** a site's `storagePrefix` is frozen at adoption. **Property adopts with `storagePrefix: "ptp"`** → its visitors' stored state is untouched, zero migration events. Sites with no prior SDK start fresh (generalist proposed prefix: `"hd"`). `legacyPrefix`, when set, performs exactly one-time read-old-write-new on init for TWO values only: a stored consent **`denied`** (compliance — an opt-out must never be orphaned) and the **visitor id** (continuity); session state is never migrated (30-min expiry). After copying, the SDK writes only new-prefix keys; legacy keys are left to rot harmlessly. Unit-tested in W4b (fresh visitor / legacy-denied / legacy-vid / both / storage-blocked cases).

### 2.3 Track-route factory

Per-site route file stays ~5 declarative lines (SEC-04 stays visible per-route):

```ts
// src/app/api/track/route.ts (per site)
import { createTrackHandler } from "@accounting-network/web-shared/analytics/server";
export const runtime = "nodejs";
export const maxDuration = 10;
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
export const POST = createTrackHandler({ siteKey: <canonical key> });
```

Factory preserves Property's route semantics verbatim (AN-03 allowlist drop, AN-04 server re-caps, AN-05 edge-geo/no-IP, AN-06 UA-heuristic + `human_confirmed` + unconditional 204, AN-07 single RPC via service role) plus the new foreign-site-key drop. Env contract per site: `SUPABASE_URL`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, documented in the site's `.env.local.example` (PF-05).

### 2.4 Optional third-party bridges

`botid`, `@microsoft/clarity`, `web-vitals` become **optional peer dependencies** of `web-shared`, loaded by dynamic import inside try/catch: a consumer that hasn't installed them builds and runs clean with those bridges inert (ED-03 fail-open applied to our own SDK). Property's installs already satisfy all three; generalist installs none at adoption (`web-vitals` recommended at composition for ED-07/OB-06).

### 2.5 Generalist composition checklist (after SDK lands)

Decisions first — both block step 2:
- **D1 — posture:** recommend `"opt-out"` (track-by-default, legitimate interest) matching the estate's documented posture; written into the consent config per AN-01. Operator may choose `"opt-in"` + banner instead.
- **D2 — canonical site key (PF-07 fix rides along):** recommend **`"general"`** everywhere — it matches the `leads.source` CHECK and all existing generalist lead rows; analytics tables are unconstrained text so nothing migrates. Set `content_strategy.site_key: "general"` in `niche.config.json` (today it says `"generalist"`), retiring the dual alias. (Newsletter table stays keyless until GAP-5 — known, accepted.)
- **D3 — GA4:** the "dark until GAP-1" decision lands here: first-party becomes the system of record at this step; operator separately decides whether to also set the GA id (ConsentedScripts makes it consent-gated either way).

Steps:
1. Env: add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (+ document all of it in `.env.local.example`).
2. `layout.tsx`: mount `ConsentProvider` + `AnalyticsProvider` with `initAnalytics({ siteKey: "general", siteName: "Holloway Davies", storagePrefix: "hd", posture: D1, noTrackPrefixes: ["/admin"] })` — no `deriveTopic` initially (topic features no-op).
3. Add the `/api/track` route wrapper (2.3).
4. `LeadForm.tsx`: wire `useFormTracking("lead_form")` (LD-02 telemetry), add the `company_url` honeypot with silent drop (LD-03), attach `visitor_id`/`session_id` to the payload (LD-05 activates). `SignupForm`: `subscribe_view`/`subscribe_submitted` events.
5. Mount `ConsentedScripts` (+ `WebVitals` if `web-vitals` installed) — GA/Clarity render only if ids set (D3).
6. Replace the bespoke `GoogleAnalytics.tsx` mount with the shared consent-gated one; delete the local component.
7. Write the SEC-08 rationale comment at each write surface (which bot control and why — honeypot on forms, UA heuristic on beacon ingest).
8. Calculator `calc_*` instrumentation: **explicitly deferred to GAP-2** (it lives in the shared renderer); TL-06 stays open until then.

### 2.6 Acceptance — §3 Verify lines verbatim (run against generalist post-composition)

- **AN-01:** "set the consent key to `denied` in devtools, interact with the page, and confirm no further beacons leave; clear it and confirm tracking resumes without reload. The posture decision is written in the consent module, not tribal."
- **AN-02:** "read the identity module: ids are random, the idle window is a named constant, and try/catch wraps all storage access. Two ids minted for the same visitor share no derivable structure."
- **AN-03:** "POST a batch containing an invented event name to the track endpoint; confirm no row lands. Grep client code for `track(` calls — every name must resolve to the allowlist type, not a raw string the type doesn't cover."
- **AN-04:** "with devtools network open, interact then close the tab — a final beacon fires on pagehide. Confirm the first tool/page view event reaches the store on a cold load (no race loss)."
- **AN-05:** "fire a tracked event with an email address in a prop value; confirm the prop is absent from the stored row. Confirm the events/sessions schema has no IP column."
- **AN-06:** "send a batch with a curl/bot UA → session row flagged bot; send a real-browser batch containing only a page_view → `human_confirmed` false; add a click event → true. Both requests receive identical 204s."
- **AN-07:** "confirm the ingest path is a single RPC call per batch; in the database, confirm anon/authenticated cannot execute it. Two concurrent batches for one session must not lose counter increments."
- **AN-08:** "inspect the events table: partitioned, retention documented, a future-month partition already exists, and an anon-key SELECT fails." *(pre-existing infrastructure — re-verified, not rebuilt; includes confirming the partition pre-create job covers the months ahead)*
- **AN-09:** "unset the third-party ids and build/run — no errors, no script tags. Opt out of tracking — no third-party script loads. Grep: nothing reads FROM the third-party tool into the site's own tables."

Plus the riding flips, by their own Verify lines: **LD-02** (form_error events land), **LD-03** (filled honeypot → indistinguishable success, no row), **LD-05** (test lead's row carries the browser's visitor id; journey view shows the conversion), **SEC-08** (every write surface has a control + in-code rationale), **PF-07** (single key `"general"` from config end-to-end — grep for any other literal).

### 2.7 Test additions (W4b suite grows with the SDK)

Pure-unit: consent state machine per posture · id minting + idle roll + `legacyPrefix` migration matrix · `scrubProps` (email/phone shapes) · `sanitiseEvents` (allowlist, envelope, caps, foreign-site-key drop) · bot heuristic fixtures · `buildSession` aggregation (human_confirmed flip, engaged-ms summation, scroll max) · experiments stamping.

### 2.8 Execution-time verifications & risks

1. `autoCapture.ts` import audit (unread; may carry further intent/site couplings — same untangle pattern as AnalyticsProvider if so).
2. Confirm the monthly partition pre-create job (Python, per AN-08 note) is running and not Property-scoped.
3. Generalist CSP: the shared header builder (W2) must include Supabase `connect-src` for beacon ingest — already in generalist's CSP today; re-verify after W2 adoption.
4. Divergence window: Property runs its local SDK copy until its adoption is approved — freeze feature work on Property's `lib/analytics` during the window (any change would have to be made twice).
5. Dashboard joins (GAP-3, Phase B) will filter `site_key = "general"` — D2 must land before any generalist data accrues, or early rows split across two keys.

### GAP-1 exit criteria (Section 2 done =)

Generalist emits sessions + events end-to-end (visible rows, human_confirmed flipping, leads stitched); all 2.6 Verify lines pass; audit verdicts flipped: AN-01..09 → pass, LD-02/03/05 → pass, SEC-08 → pass, PF-07 → pass, ED-07 vitals clause → capturing (if `web-vitals` installed). OB-03..06 remain open for GAP-3; TL-06 for GAP-2 — by design.
