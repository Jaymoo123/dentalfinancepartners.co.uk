## Manager pre-decisions

- **Suggested slug:** `uk-italy-dta-tie-breaker-property-residence-disputes`
- **Suggested category:** `non-resident-landlord-tax`
- **Bucket:** Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs)
- **Framing differentiator (READ THIS CAREFULLY — defines what makes this page distinct):**

> Where dual residence under UK SRT and Italian domestic law triggers the Art 4 tie-breaker. The cascade: permanent home, centre of vital interests, habitual abode, nationality. Italian Agenzia delle Entrate competent-authority practice. Worked example: an executive with UK and Italian homes, family in Italy, work primarily in UK — how the test resolves.

If your reasoning suggests the slug/category should differ, you may override, but log the override and reason in the per-page work-log below.

## Competitor URLs (use as primary research starting points; fetch + read yourself)

- https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/italy-tax-treaties — gov.uk hub for the UK-Italy treaty (1988 convention, in force 1991, MLI-modified); the canonical source for Art 4 tie-breaker wording in the bilateral text.
- https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/international-manual/intm154020 — HMRC INTM154020 on dual-resident individuals; the official UK interpretive framework for applying the Art 4 cascade (permanent home → centre of vital interests → habitual abode → nationality → MAP).
- https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/international-manual/intm154040 — HMRC INTM154040 on residence claims under DTAs for individuals; covers how HMRC handles the claim mechanics and the dual-resident certificate route via HS302.
- https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dual-residents-hs302-self-assessment-helpsheet — HMRC HS302 (Dual residents); the practical helpsheet referenced by HMRC's own manual for dual-resident claims, structural reference for what the page should equip the reader to do.
- https://www.ukpropertyaccountants.co.uk/uk-italy-double-taxation-agreement-dual-residence-tie-breaker-rules/ — UK specialist accountant's UK-Italy tie-breaker walkthrough; useful for the worked-example density readers expect on this topic.

> Fetch each one with `httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True, timeout=30, headers={"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})` then `BeautifulSoup(html, "lxml")`. Read what they actually have. If a URL is poor quality, do your own targeted search and document what you used in the work log.

## GSC data

*This is a net-new page; no GSC data exists for it yet. The primary topical query is implicit in the slug + framing differentiator.*

---

## Closest existing pages on our site (cannibalisation context)

*Identified by Opus reasoning on the full 316-page Property inventory (2026-05-22 regen pass), not by token similarity. Token-scored list discarded because the very low scores (0.11-0.12) returned unrelated incorporation / developer pages with no residence-test or treaty angle. Note: the SRT / dual-residence pages most semantically adjacent are themselves Wave 2 net-new siblings, listed separately below.*

- `non-resident-landlord-scheme-uk-complete-guide` (Non-Resident Landlord Tax) — [reasoning: the NRL pillar; once the tie-breaker resolves an executive as Italian-resident under the treaty, the rental side of their UK property falls into NRL, so this is the operational outcome page worth linking to.]
  - title: Non-Resident Landlord Scheme UK: Complete Guide for Overseas Property Investors
- `uk-property-income-expats-tax-obligations-explained` (Non-Resident Landlord Tax) — [reasoning: expat-landlord obligations pillar; readers arrive here on the "I work in the UK but my family is in Italy" question — this brief is the deeper treaty-mechanics version that this page should ultimately link forward to.]
  - title: UK Property Income for Expats: Tax Obligations Explained
- `tax-treaties-property-investors-treaty-framework-guide` (Non-Resident Landlord Tax) — [reasoning: the Wave 2 DTA pillar (sibling on same wave); the framework page covers Art 4 generically — this bilateral page is the Italy-specific applied version, link up.]
  - title: Tax Treaties for Property Investors: Treaty Framework Guide
- `dta-tie-breaker-test-dual-residence-property-owners` (Non-Resident Landlord Tax — Wave 2 sibling) — [reasoning: the generic Art 4 tie-breaker page (sibling brief on this wave); CANNIBAL risk if not handled deliberately — this Italy brief is the bilateral applied / worked-example version, the generic page is the framework. Sessions must coordinate H2 outlines so the Italy page leads with the bilateral wrinkle (Italian Agenzia delle Entrate practice, family-in-Italy fact pattern) and links UP to the generic.]
  - title: DTA Tie-Breaker Test for Dual-Residence Property Owners (Wave 2 sibling brief)
- `srt-statutory-residence-test-landlord-decision-tree` (Non-Resident Landlord Tax — Wave 2 sibling) — [reasoning: the SRT decision-tree page (sibling brief on this wave); the Italy tie-breaker only fires after both SRT and Italian domestic law say "resident", so this page is the upstream input. Link out for the SRT side.]
  - title: SRT Statutory Residence Test: Landlord Decision Tree (Wave 2 sibling brief)
- `non-resident-cgt-uk-property-rates-reporting` (Non-Resident Landlord Tax) — [reasoning: NRCGT rates page; if the tie-breaker resolves the executive as Italian-resident, any UK property disposal lands in NRCGT — link out for the disposal side.]
  - title: Non-Resident CGT on UK Property: What Are the Rates and Reporting Requirements?

**Cannibalisation discipline:**
- If a closest-existing page is a pillar/comprehensive guide on the topic, write the **applied / scenario / local** version and link out to the pillar.
- If a closest-existing page is shallower than your framing differentiator suggests, write the deeper page and consider linking BACK from the existing page to yours (raise the cross-link as a flag).
- If two existing pages substantially overlap with your topic, raise a cannibalisation flag and don't proceed until orchestrator response — UNLESS your framing differentiator clearly puts you on a different angle.

## Redirect overlap (on launch)

*No redirect overlap. No middleware changes needed at launch.*

You don't have to use all of these; pick the ones that fit your specific framing. Add others you find during research.

## Universal rules (do not skip)

### Voice
- **No em-dashes.** Commas, parentheses, full stops, or middle dots instead.
- Practical, specific. Exact figures, named legislation. No vague hedges.
- Anonymised personas only. No real client names. No specific NHS Trust / letting agency / tenant dispute names.

### Lead-gen architecture (global CSS — you write the placement, not the styling)
- `Property/web/src/components/blog/BlogPostRenderer.tsx` auto-injects the `LeadForm` at the bottom. **Never duplicate it in body content.**
- The `.prose-blog aside` CSS in `Property/web/src/app/globals.css` styles every `<aside>` in markdown with emerald-accent on emerald-50. **You add no classes** — just `<aside><p>headline</p><p>body</p></aside>`.
- Lead-form role segments (match each where relevant in FAQs): Individual landlord (1-3 properties) / Portfolio owner (4-10) / Large portfolio (10+) / Property developer.

### CTA placement guidance (per this page)
- Add 1-3 inline `<aside>` CTAs at high-intent moments. Conversion moments to consider:
  - After the first worked numerical example
  - After a comparison table
  - After explaining a high-cost trap or pitfall
  - At the end of a decision-framework section
- Avoid: opening the page with an aside (let the user trust you first); placing an aside inside a worked example; >3 asides total.
- Don't write the same opening sentence each time. Avoid "Many landlords ask about ...". Vary the opening per page.

### Schema
- FAQs live in frontmatter `faqs:` array. The template auto-emits FAQPage JSON-LD via `buildBlogPostingJsonLd`. **Don't add FAQ schema in body.**
- Article + FAQPage + BreadcrumbList + Organization all auto-emitted.
- Target 10-14 FAQs.
- If your topic suits HowTo schema (step-by-step process), flag in your work-log and the orchestrator will assess whether to add HowTo schema in the template (NOT in body).

### Cannibalisation
- The "Closest existing pages" section below shows what we already have on related topics. **Read those pages before writing**. Decide whether yours is the applied/scenario version (link out to the existing pillar) or vice versa.
- Do not duplicate worked numerical examples verbatim across pages. Differ figures, scenarios, or angles.

### House positions
- **Read `docs/property/house_positions.md` once at the start.** It is the tie-breaker. For Wave 2, pay particular attention to §§9-10 (headline IHT/DTAs positions) AND §§15-17 (the Wave 2 extensions covering IHT depth, DTA article-level detail, and expat / leaving-the-UK working detail). If a competitor source contradicts a house position, the house position wins; the competitor is wrong or out of date. Flag the conflict in `docs/property/wave2_site_wide_flags.md`.

### Quality bar
- Word count: roughly competitor median (typically 2,500-3,500). Do not pad past 3,500 if competitors are short. **Do not aim for a word count** — aim to cover the topic thoroughly per the framing differentiator, and let the word count fall out naturally.
- FAQs: 10-14.
- New external authority links: 4-7 from the bucket-specific list below (plus others if you find them).
- Build clean: from your worktree root, `cd Property/web && npm run build`.
- FAQ schema count in built HTML matches frontmatter array length.
- Zero em-dashes anywhere in body or FAQs.
- Zero Tailwind utility classes in markdown.
- Internal links to relevant pillar pages from the "Closest existing pages" section.

### Anti-templating
- Each Wave 2 page has a FRAMING DIFFERENTIATOR (see your assignment block). The differentiator defines what makes this page distinct from siblings in the same bucket. **Write to the differentiator** — don't write a generic "complete guide" template.
- Vary your H2 structure per page. IHT-mechanism pages and IHT-event pages should NOT have the same outline. DTA-bilateral pages must each lead with the bilateral-specific wrinkle.
- Vary your opening 2-3 sentences. Don't pattern-match.
- Vary your FAQ phrasing. Don't reuse the same "Is X tax deductible?" template across multiple pages.

## Workflow (per page; claim ONE page at a time)

1. **Read `docs/property/house_positions.md`** once at the start of your session (only re-read for edge cases). For Wave 2, §§9-10 give the headline positions and §§15-17 give the Wave-2 working detail.
2. **Claim the page** in `docs/property/wave2_page_tracker.md` — change Status `⬜ todo` to `🟡 in_progress`, add today's UTC timestamp.
3. **Read the brief** (this file). Pay attention to: framing differentiator, closest existing pages, redirect overlap, authority links.
4. **Fetch each competitor URL** using `httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True, timeout=30, headers={"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})` then `BeautifulSoup(html, "lxml")`. Decide what's worth extracting (outline, FAQs, worked examples, citation density, component patterns).
5. **Read the closest existing pages** on our site (paths in the "Closest existing pages" section). Note where they over/undershoot the topic. Decide your differentiation per the framing.
6. **Plan the rewrite/write** before touching markdown. Decide: H2/H3 outline (vary it — don't pattern-match siblings), meta title (lead with the primary query word order, **≤62 chars**), meta description (**≤158 chars**), 10-14 FAQs covering competitor patterns + GSC demand + segment qualifiers + house-position clarifications, inline aside CTA placements, cannibalisation handling.
7. **Verify factual claims** against HMRC manuals / legislation.gov.uk / gov.uk. House positions doc is the tie-breaker.
8. **Fetch a hero image from Pexels** (free, free-licence, attribution required):
   ```python
   import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.')
   from optimisation_engine.blog_generator.post_processing import fetch_image_for_post
   image = fetch_image_for_post("uk property tax")
   ```
   Pick a query that's visually evocative and topical. If Pexels returns None, leave `image: ''`.
9. **Write the markdown file** at `Property/web/content/blog/<slug>.md`. Frontmatter required fields: `title`, `slug`, `canonical`, `date`, `author`, `category`, `metaTitle` (≤62 chars), `metaDescription` (≤158 chars), `altText`, `image`, `imageCredit` (if Pexels), `h1`, `summary`, `schema: ''`, `faqs: [...]` (10-14 entries), `dateModified`, `reviewedBy`, `reviewerCredentials`, `reviewedAt`, `editorialNote`.
10. **Build:** from your worktree root, `cd Property/web && npm run build`. Must pass clean.
11. **Verify (all six checks must pass):** FAQ schema count match, 0 em-dashes, 0 Tailwind classes, meta title ≤62 chars, meta description ≤158 chars, internal links resolve.
12. **If your brief lists a redirect overlap:** edit `Property/web/src/middleware.ts` to repoint the old slug at your new page. Log your decision in the work-log.
13. **Register the new page for GSC monitoring:** insert a row into `monitored_pages`:
    ```bash
    python -c "
    import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'.')
    from optimisation_engine.competitor._db import _sql, _esc
    slug = '<your-slug>'
    cat = '<your-category>'
    _sql(f\"INSERT INTO monitored_pages (site_key, slug, page_url, rewrite_date, monitor_until, rewrite_type, notes) VALUES ('property', {_esc(slug)}, '/blog/{cat}/{slug}', CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '90 days', 'rewrite', 'Wave 2 net-new page') ON CONFLICT (site_key, slug, rewrite_date) DO NOTHING\")
    print('registered')
    "
    ```
14. **Commit on your branch.** Per-page commit (do NOT merge to main). **CRITICAL: commit BEFORE marking done in tracker.** Wave 1 had multiple tracker-ahead-of-branch drift incidents; the orchestrator calibrated mid-wave. For Wave 2 we bake the discipline in: step 14 (commit) MUST happen before step 16 (mark done).
    ```bash
    git add Property/web/content/blog/<slug>.md briefs/property/wave2/<slug>.md docs/property/wave2_page_tracker.md
    git commit -m "Wave 2 (<bucket>): write <slug>"
    ```
15. **Fill in the per-page work-log** at the bottom of this brief.
16. **Mark done** in `docs/property/wave2_page_tracker.md` (`🟡 in_progress` to `✅ done`) with a 1-line Notes summary. (Step 14 MUST be complete first.)
17. **Append any site-wide flags** to `docs/property/wave2_site_wide_flags.md` (append-only).
18. **Log discoveries** to `docs/property/wave2_discovery_log_session_<X>.md` (append-only).
19. **Next page** — claim ONE more page from the top of your remaining list.

## Session-side watcher pattern (new for Wave 2)

When you append a `STATUS: open` question to your Q&A file, spawn a Monitor task on that file watching for the `STATUS: answered` flip. Then **keep working on another step / another page** while you wait. The watcher fires when the manager has answered, you re-read the file, act, and continue.

```bash
QFILE="docs/property/wave2_questions_session_<X>.md"
LATEST_Q=$(grep -oE '^## \[Q-[0-9]+\]' "$QFILE" | tail -1)
echo "Watching for answer to $LATEST_Q..."
while true; do
  if grep -q "$LATEST_Q.*STATUS: answered" "$QFILE"; then
    echo "ANSWER_LANDED $LATEST_Q"
    break
  fi
  sleep 20
done
```

Persistent: false. Timeout: 1 hour. Do NOT block on the watcher; pick up a different page or a different step on the same page while you wait.
