## Manager pre-decisions

- **Suggested slug:** `iht-lifetime-gifts-7-year-rule-property-taper`
- **Suggested category:** `landlord-tax-essentials`
- **Bucket:** IHT and estate planning
- **Framing differentiator (READ THIS CAREFULLY — defines what makes this page distinct):**

> PETs vs CLTs for property: how the 7-year clock works on outright property gifts (PETs) vs gifts into trust (CLTs with immediate 20% IHT). Taper relief mechanics (s.7(4) IHTA 1984) including the 'why taper doesn't help if you stay within the NRB' point that's widely misunderstood. Worked example for a parent gifting a £350k BTL to a child and surviving 5 years.

If your reasoning suggests the slug/category should differ, you may override, but log the override and reason in the per-page work-log below.

## Competitor URLs (use as primary research starting points; fetch + read yourself)

- https://www.ukpropertyaccountants.co.uk/inheritance-tax-lifetime-gifts-vs-transfer-at-death/ — direct lifetime-gift-vs-death-transfer comparison; useful for the structural framing readers expect and for spotting the "taper relief reduces the gift not the tax" misconception you must explicitly correct.
- https://www.ukpropertyaccountants.co.uk/when-does-a-gift-or-transfer-become-chargeable-to-uk-inheritance-tax-iht/ — companion piece on chargeability triggers; baseline density check for the explanation level a specialist property audience expects.
- https://www.gov.uk/inheritance-tax/gifts — gov.uk citizen-facing IHT gifts page; treat as the structural anchor for the 7-year clock + £3k annual exemption + small-gifts exemption framing; competitor pages tend to under-cite this.
- https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/inheritance-tax-manual/ihtm14000 — HMRC IHTM chapter on lifetime transfers; authoritative on PET / CLT mechanics and the order in which gifts are stacked against the NRB at death.
- https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/51/section/7 — s.7 IHTA 1984 itself (taper relief table at s.7(4)); cite directly so the percentages do not enter the page via secondhand interpretation.

> Fetch each one with `httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True, timeout=30, headers={"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})` then `BeautifulSoup(html, "lxml")`. Read what they actually have. If a URL is poor quality, do your own targeted search and document what you used in the work log. Manager note (2026-05-22 regen): WebFetch was unavailable during regen so URLs were not live-verified; session verifies on first fetch.

## GSC data

*This is a net-new page; no GSC data exists for it yet. The primary topical query is implicit in the slug + framing differentiator.*

---

## Closest existing pages on our site (cannibalisation context)

*Identified by Opus reasoning on the full 316-page Property inventory (2026-05-22 regen pass), not by token similarity. Token-scored list discarded because it returned the wrong cluster (60-day CGT reporting, director loans) rather than the actual gifting / IHT-mechanism cluster.*

- `inheritance-tax-rental-property-uk-guide` (Landlord Tax Essentials) — [reasoning: the IHT pillar; lifetime-gifts pages are mechanism-level deepers and must link back to the pillar for readers who arrived without yet understanding the NRB / RNRB / taper relationship.]
  - title: Inheritance Tax on Rental Property Portfolios: UK Guide 2026
- `cgt-gifting-property-family-members-uk` (Capital Gains Tax) — [reasoning: the CGT-side companion; any IHT lifetime-gift page must surface the CGT trigger because the donor pays CGT at gift and the IHT clock starts the same day; one-page treatment of either half is incomplete advice.]
  - title: CGT on Gifting Property to Family Members in the UK (2026 Guide)
- `iht-gifts-with-reservation-of-benefit-property` (Landlord Tax Essentials) — [reasoning: sibling Wave 2 brief on GROB; this 7-year-rule page must warn that the clock does not start if the gift is a GROB, then link to the s.102 page for depth; the two pages reinforce each other.]
  - title: IHT Gifts with Reservation of Benefit (Property): The s.102 Trap, the Rent Escape, and POAT (Wave 2 sibling)
- `cgt-property-transfer-spouse` (Capital Gains Tax) — [reasoning: spouse-exemption + transferable NRB is the no-clock counterpart to PET lifetime gifts; readers planning around the 7-year rule often need to be reminded that spouse transfers don't trigger the clock at all.]
  - title: CGT on Property Transfer to Spouse: Is It Exempt?
- `fic-iht-treatment-bpr-myth` (Incorporation & Company Structures) — [reasoning: FIC share gifts are CLTs into discretionary trusts (or PETs to bare-trust children) and the 7-year clock plus 20% lifetime IHT applies; this is the company-structure deeper hop for sophisticated readers.]
  - title: FIC IHT Treatment and the BPR Myth: What Actually Saves Inheritance Tax in a Property FIC
- `cgt-divorce-property-transfer-tax-implications` (Capital Gains Tax) — [reasoning: divorce transfers within the no-gain-no-loss window do not trigger CGT but are still IHT transfers; lateral link for the readers researching family-structure transfers more broadly.]
  - title: CGT and Divorce: Property Transfer Tax Implications for UK Landlords

**Cannibalisation discipline:**
- If a closest-existing page is a pillar/comprehensive guide on the topic, write the **applied / scenario / local** version and link out to the pillar.
- If a closest-existing page is shallower than your framing differentiator suggests, write the deeper page and consider linking BACK from the existing page to yours (raise the cross-link as a flag).
- If two existing pages substantially overlap with your topic, raise a cannibalisation flag and don't proceed until orchestrator response — UNLESS your framing differentiator clearly puts you on a different angle.

## Universal rules (do not skip)

### Voice
- **No em-dashes.** Commas, parentheses, full stops, or middle dots instead.
- Practical, specific. Exact figures, named legislation. No vague hedges.
- Anonymised personas only. No real client names. No specific NHS Trust / letting agency / tenant dispute names.

### Lead-gen architecture (global CSS — you write the placement, not the styling)
- `Property/web/src/components/blog/BlogPostRenderer.tsx` auto-injects the `LeadForm` at the bottom. **Never duplicate it in body content.**
- The `.prose-blog aside` CSS in `Property/web/src/app/globals.css` styles every `<aside>` in markdown with emerald-accent on emerald-50. **You add no classes** — just `<aside><p>headline</p><p>body</p></aside>`.
- Lead-form role segments (match each where relevant in FAQs): Individual landlord (1-3 properties) / Portfolio owner (4-10) / Large portfolio (10+) / Property developer.

### CTA placement guidance (per this page)
- Add 1-3 inline `<aside>` CTAs at high-intent moments. Conversion moments to consider:
  - After the first worked numerical example
  - After a comparison table
  - After explaining a high-cost trap or pitfall
  - At the end of a decision-framework section
- Avoid: opening the page with an aside (let the user trust you first); placing an aside inside a worked example; >3 asides total.
- Don't write the same opening sentence each time. Avoid "Many landlords ask about ...". Vary the opening per page.

### Schema
- FAQs live in frontmatter `faqs:` array. The template auto-emits FAQPage JSON-LD via `buildBlogPostingJsonLd`. **Don't add FAQ schema in body.**
- Article + FAQPage + BreadcrumbList + Organization all auto-emitted.
- Target 10-14 FAQs.
- If your topic suits HowTo schema (step-by-step process), flag in your work-log and the orchestrator will assess whether to add HowTo schema in the template (NOT in body).

### Cannibalisation
- The "Closest existing pages" section below shows what we already have on related topics. **Read those pages before writing**. Decide whether yours is the applied/scenario version (link out to the existing pillar) or vice versa.
- Do not duplicate worked numerical examples verbatim across pages. Differ figures, scenarios, or angles.

### House positions
- **Read `docs/property/house_positions.md` once at the start.** It is the tie-breaker. For Wave 2, pay particular attention to §§9-10 (headline IHT/DTAs positions) AND §§15-17 (the Wave 2 extensions covering IHT depth, DTA article-level detail, and expat / leaving-the-UK working detail). If a competitor source contradicts a house position, the house position wins; the competitor is wrong or out of date. Flag the conflict in `docs/property/wave2_site_wide_flags.md`.

### Quality bar
- Word count: roughly competitor median (typically 2,500-3,500). Do not pad past 3,500 if competitors are short. **Do not aim for a word count** — aim to cover the topic thoroughly per the framing differentiator, and let the word count fall out naturally.
- FAQs: 10-14.
- New external authority links: 4-7 from the bucket-specific list below (plus others if you find them).
- Build clean: from your worktree root, `cd Property/web && npm run build`.
- FAQ schema count in built HTML matches frontmatter array length.
- Zero em-dashes anywhere in body or FAQs.
- Zero Tailwind utility classes in markdown.
- Internal links to relevant pillar pages from the "Closest existing pages" section.

### Anti-templating
- Each Wave 2 page has a FRAMING DIFFERENTIATOR (see your assignment block). The differentiator defines what makes this page distinct from siblings in the same bucket. **Write to the differentiator** — don't write a generic "complete guide" template.
- Vary your H2 structure per page. IHT-mechanism pages and IHT-event pages should NOT have the same outline. DTA-bilateral pages must each lead with the bilateral-specific wrinkle.
- Vary your opening 2-3 sentences. Don't pattern-match.
- Vary your FAQ phrasing. Don't reuse the same "Is X tax deductible?" template across multiple pages.

## Workflow (per page; claim ONE page at a time)

1. **Read `docs/property/house_positions.md`** once at the start of your session (only re-read for edge cases). For Wave 2, §§9-10 give the headline positions and §§15-17 give the Wave-2 working detail.
2. **Claim the page** in `docs/property/wave2_page_tracker.md` — change Status `⬜ todo` to `🟡 in_progress`, add today's UTC timestamp.
3. **Read the brief** (this file). Pay attention to: framing differentiator, closest existing pages, redirect overlap, authority links.
4. **Fetch each competitor URL** using `httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True, timeout=30, headers={"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})` then `BeautifulSoup(html, "lxml")`. Decide what's worth extracting (outline, FAQs, worked examples, citation density, component patterns).
5. **Read the closest existing pages** on our site (paths in the "Closest existing pages" section). Note where they over/undershoot the topic. Decide your differentiation per the framing.
6. **Plan the rewrite/write** before touching markdown. Decide: H2/H3 outline (vary it — don't pattern-match siblings), meta title (lead with the primary query word order, **≤62 chars**), meta description (**≤158 chars**), 10-14 FAQs covering competitor patterns + GSC demand + segment qualifiers + house-position clarifications, inline aside CTA placements, cannibalisation handling.
7. **Verify factual claims** against HMRC manuals / legislation.gov.uk / gov.uk. House positions doc is the tie-breaker.
8. **Fetch a hero image from Pexels** (free, free-licence, attribution required):
   ```python
   import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.')
   from optimisation_engine.blog_generator.post_processing import fetch_image_for_post
   image = fetch_image_for_post("uk property tax")
   ```
   Pick a query that's visually evocative and topical. If Pexels returns None, leave `image: ''`.
9. **Write the markdown file** at `Property/web/content/blog/<slug>.md`. Frontmatter required fields: `title`, `slug`, `canonical`, `date`, `author`, `category`, `metaTitle` (≤62 chars), `metaDescription` (≤158 chars), `altText`, `image`, `imageCredit` (if Pexels), `h1`, `summary`, `schema: ''`, `faqs: [...]` (10-14 entries), `dateModified`, `reviewedBy`, `reviewerCredentials`, `reviewedAt`, `editorialNote`.
10. **Build:** from your worktree root, `cd Property/web && npm run build`. Must pass clean.
11. **Verify (all six checks must pass):** FAQ schema count match, 0 em-dashes, 0 Tailwind classes, meta title ≤62 chars, meta description ≤158 chars, internal links resolve.
12. **If your brief lists a redirect overlap:** edit `Property/web/src/middleware.ts` to repoint the old slug at your new page. Log your decision in the work-log.
13. **Register the new page for GSC monitoring:** insert a row into `monitored_pages`:
    ```bash
    python -c "
    import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'.')
    from optimisation_engine.competitor._db import _sql, _esc
    slug = '<your-slug>'
    cat = '<your-category>'
    _sql(f\"INSERT INTO monitored_pages (site_key, slug, page_url, rewrite_date, monitor_until, rewrite_type, notes) VALUES ('property', {_esc(slug)}, '/blog/{cat}/{slug}', CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '90 days', 'rewrite', 'Wave 2 net-new page') ON CONFLICT (site_key, slug, rewrite_date) DO NOTHING\")
    print('registered')
    "
    ```
14. **Commit on your branch.** Per-page commit (do NOT merge to main). **CRITICAL: commit BEFORE marking done in tracker.** Wave 1 had multiple tracker-ahead-of-branch drift incidents; the orchestrator calibrated mid-wave. For Wave 2 we bake the discipline in: step 14 (commit) MUST happen before step 16 (mark done).
    ```bash
    git add Property/web/content/blog/<slug>.md briefs/property/wave2/<slug>.md docs/property/wave2_page_tracker.md
    git commit -m "Wave 2 (<bucket>): write <slug>"
    ```
15. **Fill in the per-page work-log** at the bottom of this brief.
16. **Mark done** in `docs/property/wave2_page_tracker.md` (`🟡 in_progress` to `✅ done`) with a 1-line Notes summary. (Step 14 MUST be complete first.)
17. **Append any site-wide flags** to `docs/property/wave2_site_wide_flags.md` (append-only).
18. **Log discoveries** to `docs/property/wave2_discovery_log_session_<X>.md` (append-only).
19. **Next page** — claim ONE more page from the top of your remaining list.

## Session-side watcher pattern (new for Wave 2)

When you append a `STATUS: open` question to your Q&A file, spawn a Monitor task on that file watching for the `STATUS: answered` flip. Then **keep working on another step / another page** while you wait. The watcher fires when the manager has answered, you re-read the file, act, and continue.

```bash
QFILE="docs/property/wave2_questions_session_<X>.md"
LATEST_Q=$(grep -oE '^## \[Q-[0-9]+\]' "$QFILE" | tail -1)
echo "Watching for answer to $LATEST_Q..."
while true; do
  if grep -q "$LATEST_Q.*STATUS: answered" "$QFILE"; then
    echo "ANSWER_LANDED $LATEST_Q"
    break
  fi
  sleep 20
done
```

Persistent: false. Timeout: 1 hour. Do NOT block on the watcher; pick up a different page or a different step on the same page while you wait.
